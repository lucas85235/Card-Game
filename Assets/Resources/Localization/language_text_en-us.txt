        {"key":"history_part3_18", "value":"Oh, not that! The AI is stored on the BOT-CHAIN, the Warbots' data network. When the Warbot loses control it is simply disconnected."},
        {"key":"history_part3_19", "value":"I understood. And have you done some sort of check on the affected AI?"},

        {"key":"history_part3_20", "value":"Yes, but without success. All that is known is that the AI is suddenly disconnected and unable to return to the robot"},
        {"key":"history_part3_21", "value":"The same goes for the botmote, which is unusable in the period"},
        {"key":"history_part3_22", "value":"Is it some kind of virus or something? I've heard that in the past, people had a hard time with malicious programs installed on their machines."},

        {"key":"history_part3_26", "value":"Ahaha! Don't be so dramatic, Elecbot. When you're not busy in Botverse, you can't stop chattering from Botmote!"},
        {"key":"history_part3_27", "value":"The virtual world is very boring. I like to feel my arms and legs! Besides, I'm always scared of that ugly avatar that has your face!"},

        {"key":"history_part3_34", "value":"Don't even start, Steven! But it was a good warm-up, PLAYER. It just wasn't better because the pieces you're wearing are already pretty worn out by time…"},
